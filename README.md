# Loan_Approval_Prediction
The aim of this project is to predict whether the loan would be approved by the bank, by analyzing the applicant's information which includes loan amount, tenure, cibil score, education, assests and many other variables. Thorugh this project, we can analyze the factors that affect the loan approval and also predict the loan approval status for a new applicant. Moreover, this will help in providing priority services to the customers who are more likely to get their loan approved.
